# 🚀 Tank Battle - OpenGL Project

## 🎯 Overview
Welcome to **Tank Battle**, a futuristic 2D tank warfare simulation built using **OpenGL**! This project brings dynamic physics-based tank battles to life with realistic terrain, movement, and projectile mechanics.

## ✨ Features
✅ **Procedural Terrain Generation** - Terrain created using **triangle strip method**, utilizing four amplitudes and four frequencies for a dynamic landscape.  
✅ **Two Fully Controllable Tanks** - Tanks move fluidly, respecting the ground elevation and adjusting their mass point accordingly.  
✅ **Realistic Projectile Mechanics** - Fire projectiles that obey gravity and interact with the terrain and tanks.  
✅ **Damage & Health System** - Tanks have health bars that decrease upon taking damage (soon to be fully real-time).  
✅ **Collision Detection** - Projectiles accurately detect and register hits on enemy tanks.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **C++** (OpenGL, GLFW, GLM)  
- **Graphics Programming** (Shaders, Transformations)  
- **Physics & Game Logic** (Projectile Motion, Collision Handling)  

## 🎮 Controls
- **Tank 1**: Move with **A/D**, aim with **W/S**, fire with **SPACE**.  
- **Tank 2**: Move with **Left/Right Arrows**, aim with **Up/Down Arrows**, fire with **ENTER**.  

## 🚀 Future Enhancements (Contribute!)
We invite you to contribute! Check out these cool upcoming features:  
🔹 **Gradual Health Bar Decrease** - Make the health bar update smoothly as tanks take damage.  
🔹 **Terrain Destruction** - Implement terrain deformation when hit by projectiles.  
🔹 **Dark Mode Toggle** - Add a feature to switch between light and dark mode.
