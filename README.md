## 🚀 Tank Battle - OpenGL Simulation

### 🎮 Overview
Tank Battle is a **2D physics-based tank combat simulation** built using OpenGL. This project features **realistic terrain generation, tank movement, projectile mechanics, and a dynamic life bar system**. The game allows two players to engage in a strategic battle where they must aim, shoot, and move tactically to win.

### ✅ Implemented Functionalities

#### 🌍 Terrain Generation
- The terrain is generated using the **triangle strip method** in OpenGL.
- Uses **four amplitude-frequency wave functions** to create a realistic, undulating battlefield.
- Ensures smooth interactions between tanks and ground.

#### 🏆 Tank Mechanics
- **Two tanks** are rendered and controlled independently.
- Movement logic accounts for terrain height to ensure tanks remain aligned with the surface.
- **Rotating turret** allows dynamic aiming and shooting.

#### 💥 Projectile System
- Players can shoot projectiles at each other.
- **Projectile trajectory influenced by gravity** for realism.
- Collision detection determines whether a projectile hits an opponent.

#### ❤️ Life Bar System
- Tanks have a **life bar** that depletes upon getting hit.
- Currently, the tank disappears after multiple hits, but **the life bar does not decrease gradually** (future improvement).

### 🔥 Future Enhancements & Contributions
We encourage **open-source contributions**! Below are key features that need improvement:

#### 🔧 Features to Implement
1️⃣ **Gradual Life Bar Depletion** - Ensure the life bar **updates in real-time** and reduces smoothly as tanks take damage.

2️⃣ **Terrain Destruction** - Make the terrain **display holes or craters** when projectiles land, increasing tactical depth.

3️⃣ **Dark Mode** - Add a **dark mode toggle** for better visibility and aesthetics.
